    <h1>social media <span>content Development</span></h1>

    <h2>The Project Proposal</h2>

    <p>Develop social media content to create awareness about the brand Chalo India World and drive traffic to the website.  </p>

    <h2>the content development process </h2>

    <p>After conducting research on the content trends in the travel industry and the target audience, primary content buckets such as informational, festive events, and engagement were created. 
    </p>

    <p>Next, the content formats were decided such as static posts and carousels for informational content, reels for festive content, and stories for engagement content. 
    </p>

    <p>Once the content calendar was prepared, the social media copies, captions and creatives were developed after thorough research. </p>

            <h2>Results</h2>

            <p>Compared to the previous content strategy of only posting static posts, highlighting a single destination, using a combination of formats resulted in more engagement. </p>
        
            <p>The reels related to festive content were found to be the best performing posts. </p>
        
            <p>This also resulted in micro and mid-tiered travel influencers and travel bloggers reaching out for collaborations. </p>
